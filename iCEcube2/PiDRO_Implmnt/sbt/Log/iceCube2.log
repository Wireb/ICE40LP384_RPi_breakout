Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 10.523 is 7.375(70.1%) logic and 3.147(29.9%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 10.323 is 7.189(69.6%) logic and 3.133(30.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 10.123 is 7.003(69.2%) logic and 3.119(30.8%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 10.123 is 7.003(69.2%) logic and 3.119(30.8%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.122 is 5.143(63.3%) logic and 2.979(36.7%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 7.922 is 4.957(62.6%) logic and 2.965(37.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 7.722 is 4.771(61.8%) logic and 2.951(38.2%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 7.922 is 4.957(62.6%) logic and 2.965(37.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.122 is 5.143(63.3%) logic and 2.979(36.7%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 8.122 is 5.143(63.3%) logic and 2.979(36.7%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
